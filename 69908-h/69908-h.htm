<p class="fs80"><b>[Mr. Smith read a very carefully prepared paper on the above subject at the Omaha meeting of the American
Prison Association. The Review would gladly print the address in full but space admits only of certain abstracts,
which follow.—<span class="smcap">Editor</span>]</b></p>


<p>In the deplorable and chaotic condition
of the very sources from which all statistical
matter must be drawn, it is hopeless
to look for any improvement in our
census statistics, unless a radical change
can be effected in state administration.
The records of the police, the courts, the
prisons, can be made of statistical value
only by the action of the state itself;
and there is apparent but one method by
which the state can act to this end.</p>

<p>There should be established in each
state a permanent board or bureau of
criminal statistics, whether as an independent
body or as a department of the
office of the attorney general or of the
secretary of state. This bureau should
be charged with the duty of prescribing
the forms in which the records of all
criminal courts, police boards and prisons
shall be kept and specifying the items
regarding which entries shall be made.
The law creating the bureau should direct
that the forms prescribed by it
should be uniform as to all institutions
of the same class to which they respectively
apply and be binding upon all institutions
within the state.</p>

<p>The bureau should issue general instructions
governing the collection and
verification of the facts to be stated in
the record; it should also be its duty,
and it should be vested with power, to
inspect and supervise the records and to
enforce compliance with its requirements.
Such a bureau might secure a collection
of reliable statistical matter, uniform in
quality throughout the state. Indiana is
now, it is believed, the only state in the
Union where such a bureau exists.</p>

<p>But even this result is not enough.
Supposing all the criminal records within
each separate state to be made uniform
without the state, still they would not be
available for comparison or for the purposes
of a national census, unless all the
states could be brought to adopt the
same form and method, so that all criminal
records throughout the Union could
be kept upon one uniform plan. Here
we encounter a serious obstacle. The
diversity and conflict of state laws are
crying evils of our time, universally recognized
and denounced, and yet the most
strenuous efforts to bring about harmonious
action between the legislatures of
separate states have always failed. No
single statute, however skilfully drawn,
proposed for universal acceptance has
ever yet been adopted by all the states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
of the Union. Still the states <em>must</em> act
in unison upon this matter of uniform
criminal records or else our statistics of
crime must continue to be a national failure
and a national reproach.</p>

<p>Not the slightest reflection can be cast
upon the federal census bureau; on the
contrary, when consideration is taken of
the fragmentary and chaotic state records
with which the census bureau had
to deal, the systematic and orderly results
and the general deductions embraced
in the census report of 1904 must
be regarded as a signal scientific triumph.</p>

<p>Uniformity in criminal records
throughout the Union we have seen to
be an imperative need. Is it a visionary
ideal, impossible of attainment? If there
is any means through which the ideal
can be realized, it is through the agency
of state bureaus of criminal statistics,
such as have just been suggested. Each
of these state bureaus, in preparing uniform
plans and forms for its own state,
would naturally place itself in touch with
the national census bureau; while the national
bureau would not be legally vested
with the slightest power to dictate to the
state bureau or to direct its action, <em>practically</em>
its wide experience and grasp of
the entire situation would enable the
federal bureau to wield commanding influence
in shaping the action of every
state bureau. If the creation of efficient
state bureaus, of the kind indicated, in
the several states could only be secured,
it is not chimerical to believe that
through the dominating influence of the
federal census bureau, tactfully exerted,
a uniform system of statistical records
relating to crime could ultimately be established
throughout the United States.
It is the first step that counts. If a few
of the leading states in the Union could
be induced to establish such a bureau;
if to Indiana could be added New York,
Illinois, Nebraska, and in the South Virginia,
the force of example would be
potent in the sister states. * * *</p>

<p>One exceedingly common and popular
error needs special mention; a marked
increase in the number of convictions for
crime indicates to the public mind an
increase necessarily in the volume of
crime committed. In fact, it may be owing
to increased activity and efficiency
on the part of the police and detective officers,
to greater severity and thoroughness
in the administration of the courts,
to a change in the economic conditions of
the community, to diminished care and
skill on the part of offenders in escaping
detection; indeed, there are many possible
factors that may have combined to
produce an unusual statistical result. A
slight change in the laws or methods of
procedure, may cause startling statistical
fluctuations.</p>

<p>For example, in the year 1890, the
number of convictions for drunkenness
in Massachusetts was 25,582; two years
later, the number had fallen to 8,634.
An amazing diminution of drunkenness
in Massachusetts—nearly 70%? Not at
all; it was owing to a new statute passed
in 1891, the effect of which was that
only those arrested for the third time
within a year were subject to conviction.</p>

<p>The congestion of population in cities
and the progress of invention necessitates
every year the enactment of numerous
statutes and municipal ordinances making
certain acts, that are harmful to the
public, misdemeanors (that is, legally
crimes); but these acts, committed in
large part through ignorance or negligence,
are not essentially of a criminal
nature. Statistically, they swell the number
of crimes committed, but most of
them are not crimes in the meaning popularly
attached to that word. These considerations
suggest that all attempts to
draw conclusions from, and to explain
the significance of the rise or fall of the
statistical barometer must be conducted
with extreme caution.</p>

<p>An error into which speakers and writers
upon crime are prone to fall is that
of regarding the statistics of crime as a
measure of the total volume of crime
committed in the country, affording an
answer to the vital question: Is crime
increasing? There are two fundamental
facts relating to crime that must never
be forgotten. First, that criminal statistics
are, and must necessarily always
be, confined to those crimes that are
known and are officially acted upon by
the police or the courts. Secondly, that
there is a large number of crimes that
are committed secretly and are never divulged,
the perpetrators of which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
never detected, and crimes that never result
in the apprehension of the offender.</p>

<p>The crimes of this second class cannot
possibly enter into any criminal statistics
and yet they form a very large part
of the total volume of crime committed.
It does not seem to be commonly appreciated
that these unpublished, unpunished
crimes, which can never be included in
any criminal statistics, probably far exceed
in number those that are followed
by conviction and punishment. * * *</p>

<p>In addition to unpublished crimes,
there are numerous cases where crime is
committed and reported to the police,
but proceed no further. In these instances,
the offender may be known, but
has escaped or the offender is unknown
and eludes detection; in either case there
is no conviction and the crime remains
unpunished. * * *</p>

<p>Perhaps the highest value of criminal
statistics consists in the light they may
throw upon the practical effects produced
by penal legislation, by judicial
procedure and by the administration of
police and detective officers. For example,
within the past decade, radical
changes in the administration of justice
have been established in this country by
laws relating to juvenile offenders, and
by the extended use of the suspended
sentence and probation. A question has
arisen in many minds whether the severity
of the penal law has not thus been
unduly relaxed. It is a matter of supreme
importance to know whether and
how far, the tenderness of the modern
law toward children serves to rescue
them from a life of crime—to know
whether the clemency of the law toward
adults by suspension of sentence and probation
promotes their rehabilitation, and
to know to what class of offenders this
clemency may properly be extended—to
know whether these milder methods of
treatment are affording adequate protection
to the public or whether sterner
measures of restraint and discipline may
be made more effective in repressing
crime.</p>

<p>These vital questions can receive final
answer only by following the subsequent
career of the offenders to whom these
methods are applied and thus gaining
data for statistical tabulation. In the
same way, the virtue of the indeterminate
sentence ought to be substantiated by
the statistical test. Statistics can be made
to show what class of crimes comes most
frequently before the courts in a given
community, and whether an increase in
the severity of punishment tends to increase
or diminish the number of convictions.</p>

<p>A movement is now in progress which
may greatly widen the scope of criminal
statistics. It has long been realized that
many persons sentenced for crime are
feeble-minded and seriously defective;
mentally and physically but, within the
past few years, the conviction has been
growing that our penal system is radically
imperfect in that it provides no adequate
means for deciding whether or not
a person on trial for crime is really responsible
criminally. * * *</p>

</div>

<p class="fs80"><b>[In the current annual report of the Minister of Justice as to the penitentiaries of Canada, appears an interesting
account, partly historical, of the Canadian parole system. We print portions of the report.]</b></p>


<p>Adult criminals seem to have been
under a “ticket of leave” system in England,
as far back as the year 1666, in the
reign of Charles II, when a statute was
passed, giving judges power of sentencing
offenders to “transportation to any
of His Majesty’s dominions in North
America.” This authority was re-affirmed
by another statute passed in the
year 1718, during the reign of Charles
I. In England and France, at that time,
adult criminals, also juvenile or minor
offenders, were placed on a sort of parole,
and given over to societies, or orders,
for supervision, while the state still
held custody of them, which custody
was relaxed as the good effects of their
being thus placed became more apparent.
The ticket of leave system grew
out of the transportation of criminals by
England to her colonial possessions.
Transportation ceased temporarily in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
1775, because of the war with her American
colonies, but it was revived in 1786,
and a consignment of convicts was also
sent in this year to New South Wales.</p>

<p>The control of this colony was not
regulated by statute, but was left to the
wisdom of the colonial governor. The
necessity of raising crops for their sustenance,
the construction of buildings,
and the making of homes for the colonists,
induced the governor greatly to
modify the sentences of the well-disposed
prisoners, that he might have a
needed moral and possibly a physical
support from them in his administration.
He set many of them free, and gave them
grants of land, and afterwards assigned
to these men, thus free, other convict
laborers who were being received from
the mother country. Following this precedent
it became the custom for the governors
of different penal settlements to
manage each according to his own ideas,
and the custom developed into granting
such liberties as have been included in
the ticket of leave system.</p>

<p>The holder of the ticket of leave,
which was granted to the convict who
had satisfactorily fulfilled a certain period
of his sentence in the cellular prisons
then adopted in the penal settlements,
would be granted the freedom of the colony
during the remainder of his sentence,
but he was placed under certain
restrictions, such as being confined to
certain districts unless he received a pass
to go elsewhere, and also being obliged
to present himself for inspection to the
authorities monthly, quarterly or yearly,
as provided for in his license, and being
prohibited from carrying fire-arms or
weapons of any kind, except under special
permission. The ticket of leave was
first legalized during the reign of George
IV, between 1820 and 1830, and in 1834
it was regulated by a statute, which defined
the minimum periods of sentence
by which a ticket of leave could be
gained. For example, it required a service
of four years for a seven year sentence,
six years for a sentence of eight,
and fourteen years for a life sentence,
in what was termed “assigned service or
government employed.” These periods
could be increased by the slightest misconduct
on the part of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Under this law a convict who had held
a ticket of leave without having been
guilty of misconduct, and who was recommended
by responsible persons in the
district where he resided, could have his
application for a full pardon transferred
by the governor of the colony for the
consideration of the Crown, but Sir Robert
Burke, in a report made by him in
1838, intimates that convicts were
granted ticket of leave to some extent at
the discretion of the home government
upon application of influential persons
in England. Under this system the convict
on ticket of leave was entitled to
his earnings. In case of misconduct, the
employer could complain to the nearest
magistrate, who could order the convict
to be flogged, condemned to work on the
roads, or in the chain gang. Any magistrate
could order 150 lashes, until the
year 1858, when the number was limited
to 50. A convict, if ill-treated, might lay
a complaint against his master, but for
that purpose he must go before a bench
of magistrates, the majority of whom
were owners of convict labor and masters
of assigned convict servants. Such
abuses grew up under this system as to
make life a living hell for the convicts.</p>

<p>In the year 1838 a committee of parliament
condemned the system of transportation,
with its attached evils, as “being
unequal, without terrors to the criminal
classes, corrupting both the criminal
and colonists, and very expensive.” They
recommended the establishment of penitentiaries
instead. It was then ordered
that no convicts should be assigned for
domestic service, and in the year 1840
transportation to Australia was stopped
entirely.</p>

<p>Another advance was made in the year
1842, which was called the “probation
system.” It was founded on the idea of
passing convicts through various stages
of control and discipline, by which it was
hoped to instill a more progressive system
for their improvement. Probation
gangs were established in Van Dieman’s
Land, through which all convicts for
transportation were to pass. These gangs
were scattered through the colony, and
were employed on public works under
the control of the government. A school
master or a clergyman was to be attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
to each gang. From the probation
gang, the convict passed into a stage
during which he might, with the consent
of the governor, engage in private service
for wages, but he was required to
pay the government a part of the wages,
which was retained as security, and forfeited
if the convict was guilty of any
misconduct. Next followed a ticket of
leave with the same privileges, save that
the freedom of the convict was greatly
enlarged. The last stage was that of a
conditional pardon. This probation system
failed, as Sir Edmond Ducaine
stated, for several reasons: 1st—that
suitable means were not provided for insuring
proper order or discipline in the
probation gang; 2nd—that the officers
of the gangs were characterized by insubordination
and vices, unnatural crimes
being proven to exist to a terrible extent;
3rd—that the demand for labor was
found to be very insufficient to employ
the ticket of leave portion of the men,
so that idleness soon destroyed all the
good that had been accomplished under
the probation system. The difficulty may
be summed up in one or two words—they
did not get to the root of the matter
as regards discipline and labor, and
there was an entire absence of mental
and moral training.</p>

<p>In the year 1846, Mr. Gladstone decided
that all transportation of convicts
to the outside colonies must be suspended,
and in 1847 the present system
of imprisonment was adopted, under
which convicts must pass through the
prisons before a conditional release will
be granted. Under the present system
of penal servitude in England, there are
three distinct stages of operation. During
the first, which generally lasts nine
months, recently greatly reduced in number,
the prisoner passes his whole
time, except meetings and exercise, in
his cell apart from all other prisoners,
working at some employment, but always
kept separate and alone. During
the second stage he eats and sleeps in
his cell, but works in association with
other prisoners. During the third period
he is conditionally released, but is kept
under the surveillance of the police, reports
at stated periods, and is returned
to prison for any infraction of his licence.
The system is altogether automatic
in its operation, and as far as I can
ascertain about one-half of the entire
number released on ticket of leave, lapse
into crime again.</p>

<p>The “Prevention of Crimes Act”
passed in 1871 provides that any person
convicted a second time of an indictable
offence may be sentenced to be subject
to the supervision of the police for seven
years after the expiration of his sentence.</p>

<p>The system of conditional liberation
was adopted by the king of Saxony, in
1862. In the same year it was adopted
by the grand duchy of Oldenburg, by the
Canton of Sargovie in Switzerland, in
1868; the kingdom of Servia, in 1869,
the German Empire, in 1871, Denmark,
in 1879; the Swiss Canton of Vaud, in
1875, also in the same year, the Kingdom
of Croatia in Hungary, the Canton
of Unter Walden, in 1878, the Netherlands,
in 1881, the Empire of Japan, in
1882, the French Republic in 1885, and
since these dates it has been adopted in
Austria, Italy and Portugal. The system
of parole, or conditional liberation, is
also now in vogue in many of the United
States.</p>

<p>The Canadian parole system, first
adopted for the penitentiaries in the year
1899, and since extended to the jails and
reformatories, differs from any system
now in operation in the entire world, and
will compare favorably with any of them.
There is nothing automatic in the operation
of this system, and it does not conflict
with the remission earned in the
penitentiaries, which applies to all prisoners
whose conduct and industry merit
consideration.</p>

<p>What, then, is the parole system? I
do not like the general term “ticket of
leave,” which has been the outcome of
many failures, and resulted in the abuse
of many systems, for the term ticket of
leave is one which handicaps the prisoner
who carries this synonym of “jail
bird” printed in large letters on his license,
but the word parole, “my word of
honor,” is a much better term, and more
within the true meaning of a conditional
release.</p>

<p>It can be said, in view of the various
methods adopted in many countries, that
these systems all acknowledge the principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of conditional liberty to the citizen
who has forfeited it by crime, and that
a gradual restoration and rehabilitation
is not only feasible, but is expedient to
the higher and best interests of the state.
It is a system which strengthens the
weak, and fits them again for contact
with society, and when they are sufficiently
strong, restores them to full liberty
and good citizenship. The parole system
of Canada not only gives the released
prisoner police supervision, which is an
absolute necessity in keeping in touch
with them, but it makes provision for a
parole officer, as Sir Charles Fitzpatrick
demonstrated to the house of parliament,
as a “go-between” the police and the
prisoner, giving the prisoner protection,
sympathy and care in a time when he
most needs a helping hand.</p>

<p>The parole system came in vogue in
Canada under the late Honorable David
Mills, then Minister of Justice, in the
year 1899. He was followed by Sir
Charles Fitzpatrick, who not only took
a deep interest in the system, but he
placed it on a well-organized plan of
operation, and the present minister of
justice, the Honorable A. B. Aylesworth,
has been working out this organization
with splendid success. The minister of
justice occupies a unique position, having
at his command the reports from the
trial judges, the parole officer, the wardens
and jailors of the institutions and
the dominion police, for the investigation
of complex cases. His position is a much
stronger one than that of a “board of pardons,”
or any local system operated in
other countries, and it would be a step
backward to even consider an alteration
of our Canadian system. The minister of
justice considers every application for a
parole on its merits, and free from local
prejudice or influence.</p>

<p>It has also been demonstrated that the
Canadian parole system is working harmoniously
with the principles of law and
order in every community in which it is
in operation, and that it has never been
governed by that mawkish sentimentality
which would convert a penitentiary
into a summer resort, with perfumed
baths, carpets, paintings, or orchestras
for the prisoners. The administration
realizes that the inmates are criminals,
sentenced to confinement on account of
crime, and to convert a penitentiary into
a place of recreation and amusement
would be to pervert the purposes for
which it was instituted. In our Canadian
institutions, men are punished for criminal
offences, and on this fact or basis
only the mercy of a parole can be safely
administered. One fact I desire to lay
stress upon is that our convicts receive
a wholesome, humane treatment which
leads to the beneficial results of our parole
system.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MASSACHUSETTS_PRISON_ASSOCIATION">THE MASSACHUSETTS PRISON ASSOCIATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="center fs80"><b>[From a leaflet just issued by the Massachusetts Prison Association we take the following facts:]</b></p>


<p>The Association was formed in 1899
to enlighten public opinion concerning
the prevention and treatment of crime,
to secure the improvement of penal legislation,
and to aid released prisoners in
living honorably. Until the Association
was formed, there was no organization
in the state to do the work of “enlightening
public opinion concerning the prevention
and treatment of crime.” The
literature of the Association has been
distributed widely for educational purposes.
Its annual appeal for Prison Sunday
has met with a response from many
churches, and a greatly improved public
sentiment has been developed. During
1910 the Association printed and distributed
75,000 pages of printed matter.
The public press and the lecture platform
has been used also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Three important changes have been
made through the efforts of the Association,
in the probation laws. Arrested persons
who, after investigation by the probation
officer, are found to be occasional
offenders, are released from the station,
by his direction, with a warning that a
record has been made, and that another
offense may be followed by punishment,
38,813 being so released in 1910. Since
the time available before the opening of
the court does not permit a full investigation
of all cases, doubtful ones are
sent to the court which has authority to
release the occasional offender without
arraignment. The offender suffers from
public exposure in court, but is saved
from the stigma of a trial and conviction;
25,295 were so released in 1910.</p>

<p>Commitment to prison formerly followed
immediately after the imposition of
a fine, if it was not paid on the spot. A
new law, secured by the Association, authorizes
the court to give a prisoner time
to get his fine. He is placed under the supervision
of a probation officer, to whom
he pays the fine. The receipts from fines
collected last year under the suspended
sentence amounted to $25,379.</p>

<p>In connection with the abolition or the
establishment of correctional institutions,
the Association has succeeded in bringing
about the abolition of the South Boston
house of correction, and the establishment
of the Shirley state industrial school
for boys, a reformatory on the farm
school plan for boys between the ages
of 15 and 18. Through the efforts of
the Association probation officers have
been appointed in the superior court. In
1906 the society played a prominent part
in bringing about the treatment of juvenile
offenders as delinquents rather than
as criminals. Back in 1900 the Association
advocated a bill, which was passed
providing for a central probation bureau.
Not until 1908, through another
law, was the principle of this bill put
into execution. The Association secured
a law expediting criminal trials by giving
the lower courts jurisdiction over a greater
number of offenses.</p>

<p>Recently the society has secured the
passage of a law requiring the state
inspectors of health to make an annual
inspection of police stations, lockups and
houses of detention, and to make rules
for such places, relative to the care and
use of drinking cups, dishes, bedding
and ventilation. The law requires that
no such places shall be built, hereafter,
until the plans have been approved by the
state board. A supplementary law extended
this provision to jails and houses
of correction.</p>

<p>In the assisting of discharged prisoners
the Association has often filled the
place of next friend. In 1910 the Association
gave relief to 335 different men.
The receipts of the Association were in
1910 $3,682, and the expenditures, $3,678.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="NEW_PRISON">A NEW KIND OF PRISON</h2>
</div>


<p>At the annual meeting of the American
prison association at Omaha, Mr. W.
C. Zimmerman, state architect of Illinois,
presented to the careful scrutiny
of most of the principal wardens in the
United States a half-section model of
the new cell house which is to be the
unit of construction in the proposed Illinois
state prison of which Mr. Zimmerman
is the architect. In view of the
novelty of the prison plan proposed by
Mr. Zimmerman and in view furthermore
of the general approval, often enthusiastic,
which the wardens gave to
the plan and the model, a brief description
is submitted herewith to the readers
of the Review.</p>

<p>At present the prevailing construction
of cell blocks in the United States
embodies the following features: (a)
the walls of the building; (b) the corridor
next the wall; (c) the cell blocks,
which are back to back, except for the
so-called utility corridor which separate
the rows of cells. In short, it is a
cell block built within a building known
as the cell house. It is obvious that the
natural light for the cells must come
through windows in the wall of the
building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_008" style="max-width: 44.8125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80">Half-section Model of Proposed Illinois State Prison Cell Houses.
(See “A New Kind of Prison,” <a href="#NEW_PRISON">page 7</a>)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>European prison construction is the
exact opposite, in that the cells are built
on the “outside” principle, that is, up
against the walls of the cell house. The
corridor, therefore, is in the middle of
the cell house and each cell has a room
to itself with a barred window to the
outside air.</p>

<p>The “inside” cell construction in the
United States has been held to have several
distinct advantages, for the utility
corridor, containing the various pipes,
wires, etc., is an economical form of construction.
The cells on the “inside” are
furthermore safer in that the cell door
acts as a window and the prisoner in order
to escape must first go through the
cell door, then through the wall of the
cell house and then over the wall of the
prison grounds.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_009" style="max-width: 91.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80">Plan of Proposed Illinois State Prison. (See “A New Kind of Prison,” <a href="#NEW_PRISON">page 7</a>)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Prisons built on the “inside” plan are
strongly criticised because of the limited
amount of direct sunlight and direct
fresh air that may be admitted to
the cells. The importance of these two
essentials of life is obvious. A further
objection to the “inside” cell plan is that
as the cells have no doors, the acts and
the words of one prisoner can be readily
heard or learned throughout a good part
of the cell house. Supervision with
either the “inside” or the “outside” plan
is at present carried on through the patrolling
of the corridors by a guard.</p>

<p>The plan evolved by Mr. Zimmerman
for the cell house of the new Joliet prison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
seemingly overcomes the above objections
in a most careful manner. It
is proposed by Mr. Zimmerman to build
circular shaped cell houses about 120 feet
in diameter, placing the cells against the
cell house wall and thus assuring direct
light and air. Now comes the novelty.
Instead of having an open front of steel
bars, heavy glass will be fitted into the
open space between these bars so as to
make a completely closed room out of
the cell. A full view, however, of this
room is possible from a central point.
This central point is a steel shaft in the
center of the cell house, enclosing a
circular stairway. The stairway will be
as high as the highest tier of cells, and
from a position half way up the circular
stairway, which is completely sheathed
with steel, the guard within the “conning
tower” has a full view of each and
every cell, at the mere turn of his head.
The shaft will be arranged with narrow
slots opposite the level of the eye so
that it will be impossible for inmates
to see the guard and impossible to
know at what time they are under observation.
The shaft will be bullet proof,
which in case of possible mutiny assures
absolute safety for the guard. An
armed guard could undoubtedly from
his secure position readily control a mob
even though the mob be fully armed.
Entrance to the shaft will be possible
only through a tunnel which opens into
the administration building outside the
prison enclosure.</p>

<p>A number of these circular cell houses
will be erected as indicated in the group
plan here published. That this arrangement
lends itself most readily to extension
is evident.</p>

<p>Another novel feature is the possibility
of classification of prisoners in different
groups. Easily moving partitions
will be erected as high as the upper tier
of rooms and placed with sufficient frequency
so that no prisoner can see from
his cell into that of any other cell, an arrangement
which does not interfere with
the view of the guard in the “conning
tower” into any room of the cell house.</p>

<p>Escape seems practically impossible,
for the guard in the “conning tower”
will have at his hand a complete system
of levers, push buttons, etc., electrically
controlled in such a way that at any
time the locks of any or all of the tiers
may be locked or unlocked and the lights
in any or all of the cells may be dimmed
or increased.</p>

<p>In order that all rooms may obtain direct
sunlight the roof will be made
largely of glass and the diameter of the
cell house is sufficiently large to admit of
the shining of the sun into the lowest
tier of rooms facing the north. Most
of the rooms will enjoy direct sunlight
at some period of the day through the
outside window.</p>

<p>The building of this prison in Illinois
will be watched with great interest by all
those in the United States interested in
the construction of prisons and in the
proper housing of the delinquent. The
circular form of prison is not entirely
new. In 1901 a circular prison was
built in Haarlem, Holland, to accommodate
about 400 inmates. The Haarlem
prison, however, has wooden doors for
each cell which renders the supervision
of the prisoners much more difficult.
The specially new features of Mr. Zimmerman’s
plan are the glass inside front,
the circular form of construction, the
central stairway with its “conning tower,”
the partition providing for the obstruction
of vision, for the classification
of prisoners and the elimination of a
number of the attendants otherwise
needed for supervision. Mr. Zimmerman
believes that this cell house can be
built for ten per cent. less than the
familiar rectangular cell block.</p>

</div>


<p>The first annual meeting of the National
Prisoners’ Aid Association was
held at Omaha, Nebraska, on Monday,
October 16, while the members of the
Association were in attendance upon
the American Prison Association annual
meeting in that city. That the National
Prisoners’ Aid Association meeting was
encouraging to its members there can
be no doubt. In fact two meetings were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
held, one an adjourned meeting. At
each meeting from 30 to 40 members
were present.</p>

<p>In a report sent out by the secretary
to the various prisoners’ aid societies in
the United States, the following paragraphs
occur:</p>

<p>Vice President F. Emory Lyon was
in the chair. After Mr. Lyon had stated
the purpose of the annual meeting and
had outlined briefly the history of the
Association, the Secretary, O. F. Lewis
of New York, was asked to report. The
main business presented by Mr. Lewis
was the question of the publication of
the Review, a monthly periodical of sixteen
or more pages, which has been published
since January, 1911, in the interest
of the National Prisoners’ Aid Association
by Mr. Lewis as editor.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis showed that the receipts of
the Review had been up to the 6th of
October $503.67, that the disbursements
for the same period had been $445.97,
leaving a balance of $57.70 in the treasury;
that the principal items had been</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis then raised the question of
the continuance of the publication of the
Review. The expression was unanimous
that the Review was a useful paper and
should be continued and developed; that
the affiliating societies should so far as
possible obtain contributions and raise
their own contributions to the Review;
that the Review should be continued to
be published by Mr. Lewis; that the
affiliating societies should furnish more
information for the Review than during
the last year. Mr. Lewis on his part
stated that he would gladly continue to
be editor of the Review and would do
what he could to obtain further contributions
in New York and vicinity.</p>

<p>The meeting then proceeded to consider
the nomination and election of officers
for the ensuing year. After a
frank and sincere discussion as to the
proportional representation on the board
of officers and executive committee of
the various associations represented in
the national association, it was voted on
motion of Mr. Lewis that a nominating
committee of five be appointed from the
floor and the following persons were
named:</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons of Minnesota, Mr. Lewis
of New York, Mr. Cornwall of Massachusetts,
Mr. McClaren of Oregon and
Mr. Messlein of Illinois.</p>

<p>The meeting was then adjourned until
5.30 of the same date.</p>

<p>The adjourned meeting of the National
Prisoners’ Aid Association was held
at 5.30 P. M., October 16, 1911, at the
Hotel Rome, Omaha. Vice President
Lyon in the chair.</p>

<p>The nominating committee brought in
the following list of officers and executive
committee for election: President:
Judge Carver of Topeka, Kansas; Vice
President: William R. French of Chicago;
Secretary and Treasurer: O. F.
Lewis of New York; Executive Committee:
General Edward Fielding, Chicago;
F. Emory Lyon, Chicago; E. A.

Portland, Oregon; R. B. McCord, Atlanta.
Georgia; and A. H. Votaw, Philadelphia,
Pa.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Fredenhagen, the
above persons were elected officers and
members of the executive committee respectively.</p>

<p>A brief discussion followed on methods
of supporting the Review.</p>

<p>It was voted that the executive committee
of the National Prisoners’ Aid
Association should in their discretion
ask of the American Prison Association
that the National Prisoners’ Aid Association
be recognized as a section of the
American Prison Association, and that
it should have on the program of the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NEW_YORK_CITYS_BOARD_OF_INEBRIETY">NEW YORK CITY’S BOARD OF INEBRIETY</h2>
</div>


<p>The city of New York has taken initial
steps to make more adequate provision
for dealing with inebriates and
persons arrested for public intoxication.
Following the enactment of a law authorizing
the city to establish such a
board, the board of estimate and apportionment
of the city appointed a special
committee to inquire into the feasibility
and advisability of undertaking such a
work. As a result of the report of the
committee the board of estimate and apportionment
decided to initiate the
work. In accordance with provisions of
the law, the mayor appointed a board of
five members. The commissioner of
public charities and the commissioner of
correction are ex-officio members of the
board.</p>

<p>This board has started its preliminary
work. Possible sites for institutions
have been studied and a request for
funds for carrying on the work of the
board has been made to the city authorities.
In the budget for the coming year,
provision is made for a sufficient amount
of money for the board to secure a secretary
and necessary office assistance.
The appointment of a secretary, who
can give his whole time to the work, will
enable the board to study the problem
further and formulate more in detail
their plans and present them to the city
for its ratification by providing the necessary
funds for carrying them out.</p>

<p>This board has been established to do
a most important piece of work. It will
provide not only a hospital and industrial
colony for the care of inebriates,
but will establish under its jurisdiction a
system of special probation work for
cases of intoxication. The work of the
board will doubtless be watched by persons
interested in this work all over the
country. A measure similar to the New
York city law, giving authority to any
city of the first or second class in the
state of New York to make provision
for the care and treatment of inebriates,
was enacted at the last session
of the legislature, and a committee has
been formed in the city of Buffalo to
secure the adoption of the plan in that
city.</p>

<p><cite>The American Prison Association.</cite>—Under
the title, “The Problem of Prisons.”
the Outlook describes thus the recent
annual meeting:</p>

<p>“A noteworthy interest in the proper
employment of the prisoners in American
prisons, reformatories, and jails was
the keynote of the annual congress of
the American prison association held recently
at Omaha. This interest resulted
in the appointment of a special committee,
in which the name of the president
of the American federation of labor is
found among others, to investigate thoroughly
prison labor conditions in this
country and to report recommendations
at the next year’s congress in Baltimore
as to the best labor methods to be pursued
in the correctional institutions of
the various states. No more far-reaching
action has been taken by the American
prison association in the last decade.
The sessions of the Omaha congress
teemed with aspects of the labor problem.
From New Zealand the success of
reforestation by prisoners was reported:
from Toronto, the remarkable working
of convicts on a wide prison farm without
armed guards. From the District of
Columbia came reports of several successful
years of collection of important
sums from convicted offenders on probation,
for the benefit and support of
their families. Colorado has built almost
half a hundred miles of state road
by prisoners in the open, and other
states have emulated the record. The
congress was permeated with the feeling
that prisoners should be steadily and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
profitably employed, not exploited by
state or corporation or individual, and
that so far as possible the families of
prisoners should receive some portion of
their earnings. Two other currents
were strongly felt: one for the rational
development of recreation in correctional
institutions, the other for the more
careful study of the mental and physical
condition of each inmate. Baseball, lectures,
concerts, prison schools, and other
educational features were warmly advocated.
Outdoor sports on a week-end
half-day were held to be not only a valuable
‘exhaust pipe’ for pent-up spirits
and emotions developed in a necessarily
abnormal condition of living, but also a
distinct part of the plan of re-creation
that is a prominent purpose of imprisonment.
As to mental and physical defectives,
the testimony of specialists was
strong, not only that a considerable percentage
of prison inmates are mentally
backward and deficient, thus requiring
special treatment rather than ordinary
prison discipline, but that many industrial
and living conditions, in which offenders,
young and old, have found
themselves, tend predominantly to crime.
In several sessions emphasis was laid
also on the deplorable absence of statistics
regarding crime in the United
States, it being shown to be impossible
to-day to tell whether crime is increasing
or decreasing or what the general results
of imprisonment in prisons or reformatories
are. Encouraging indeed was the
frank introspection that the prison wardens
and boards of managers gave to
this and their own work. Of special interest
was the report of Attorney-General
Wickersham on the success up to
the present time of the parole system for
United States prisoners, who now may
be paroled, if first offenders, at the end
of a third of the maximum term of
their imprisonment, by the action of a
board of parole consisting of the warden
of the penitentiary in which the prisoner
is confined and representatives of the
Federal department of justice. The Attorney-General
advocated the extension of the parole system to cover the cases
of life prisoners, details of administration
of which would naturally be worked
out in legislation.”</p>

<p><em>Convicts on Roads.</em>—Warden Wolfer
of the Minnesota state prison is quoted
in the Des Moines, Iowa, Capital as follows:</p>

<p>“The use of convicts in building roads
is wrong in principle. In the first place
the sight of convicts upon the public
highways has a detrimental effect upon
the young people, it is apt to inspire in
them any but the purest of thoughts. But
the worst effect is upon the convict himself.
He is subject to public shame and
humiliation, and if he is making an effort
to reform, he becomes easily discouraged.
I have no objection to preparing
the stone and other materials for
road building by the prisoners, provided
it is done within the prison walls. The talk
that the use of convicts upon the highway
will eliminate the conflict between convict
labor and free labor does not prove out.
The exhibition of the convict upon the
highway only tends to aggravate the conflict,
as it gives the lazy free laborer a
chance to claim that he would work on
the roads if it wasn’t for the convict. It
is too expensive a method of road building.”</p>

<p><em>The Occoquan Workhouse.</em>—The entire
supervision of the District of Columbia
workhouse at Occoquan probably
will soon be given to the Board of Charities.
Under the law charitable, correctional,
and penal institutions in the
District come under the board’s supervision.
The workhouse will, it is believed,
shortly emerge from the engineering
stage and be ready to pass under
the control of the board, as is the jail
at present.</p>

<p><em>Antiquated Methods at Fall River.</em>—The
citizens of Fall River, Mass., have
recently been aroused by a revelation of
conditions prevailing in the central station
house of that city. Because of the
lack of modern detention quarters, children,
women and men of all degrees of
vice are crowded together in a common
compartment. A clergyman, who investigated
the place, says:</p>

<p>“I found two children there, a boy
and a girl, about twelve years of age. At
night the station filled up with its inevitable
horde of drunkards and offending
women, whose language, if not immediate
presence, was forced upon these
children. I called upon the boy on Sunday
and found him the companion of the
loose women whose cases were to be
heard in court Monday morning. I have
nothing to say in regard to the accommodation
of the men and women who
must needs be shut up. But I think the
treatment accorded to these children was
outrageous.</p>

<p>“Why were they there? For the inexcusable,
the damnable reason, that there
was nothing else to be done with them.
I am not criticising the officers of the
central station. They are extremely kind
to these children. It is the city of Fall
River that is responsible. The community
is committing an offence against children.
If the city, as by all means it
should, will take in hand either to punish
or reform little children, it ought
to make provision to properly accommodate
such.”</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><em>Convict Labor in Colorado.</em>—The rapidly
spreading custom of employing convict
labor on the roads is strongly indorsed
by the experience of Governor
Shafroth of Colorado. Under the Colorado
system, Governor Shafroth says:</p>

<p>“The prisoners, in large gangs and with
but two overseers in charge, work on the
state roads, and at times are two hundred
miles distant from the penitentiary.
There is no confinement, guards or other
precaution, yet during the past year there
was a net loss of only two men by escape.
In one instance a piece of road
was constructed through solid rock for
$6,000, that would have cost $30,000 under
the contract system.”</p>

<p>That the convicts are reconciled to the
conditions, the Governor explains is due
to a law providing that the time of every
prisoner is commuted ten days for every
thirty he works upon the roads, and the
penalty of three years added to the original
term of very convict who escapes,
in case he is recaptured. The convicts
are in better health than they can possibly
be when kept in prison, and work
harder than men who are paid by the
day.</p>

<p><em>Night Court Proposed for Baltimore.</em>—A
night court, modeled after the Night
Court of New York city, should be incorporated
in the proposed reform of
the police magistracy system of Baltimore,
according to Justice Alva H. Tyson.
He believes that the numerous instances
of innocent people having to
spend a night in a cell in a police station
is a relic of a crude governmental
system, beyond which Baltimore should
have passed years ago.</p>

<p>Another great field in Baltimore for
charitable endeavor has been exploited in
New York—that is probationary systems
for women. Under the present magistracy
system of Baltimore, almost all
women who are arrested on minor
charges, unless hardened criminals, have
to be dismissed. What is a magistrate
today to do with a woman on her first
offense of having too much to drink
in the opinion of a police officer?
There should be a probationary official to
whom she could be released and who
could look after her future conduct.</p>

<p><em>Farm Work for “Convalescent” Offenders.</em>—A
new plan, intended to give
Kansas convicts a new idea of life, has
been put into effect at the Kansas penitentiary,
according to the report of Warden
J. K. Codding to Governor Stubbs.
Every man that is sent to the prison is
given six months’ work on the farm just
previous to his release. The men get
out in the open. They are tanned and
sunburned, have more liberty, less discipline,
get close to nature and leave the
prison with the hatred of men and laws
gone and really wanting to try to live
better lives. Since the new system has
been tried not one released convict has
come back. Warden Codding believes
that through this system Kansas may
gain a record for a minimum number of
second-term men which will be lower
than that of any other state.</p>

<p>Many years ago an island in the Missouri
river was sold to the state. The
island has never been used, and the lands
owned by the state around the prison
have never been used to any great extent
for farming. Warden Codding began
work two years ago, and the first thing
he did was to give the prisoners half an
hour’s liberty each day in the prison yard.
The men can do anything they wish during
that half hour. They can talk to
each other and the guard, play ball, pitch
horse shoes, play croquet or a dozen other
games.</p>

<p>The prisoners had been morose and
sullen, and there were twenty-two insane
prisoners in the hospital and a half dozen
tuberculosis patients. The plan was
adopted to see if the insanity and tuberculosis
could not be stopped. Not a new
patient has developed in 14 months, and
there is not a single prisoner in the tuberculosis
hospital at this time.</p>

<p>“The farm does two things of great
importance,” says Warden Codding.
“The first is that it gives the men a new
aspect of life as they are about to leave
the prison. The farm work and a half
hour recreation period have reduced the
ordinary prison vices seventy per cent.
The plan of working the men on the farm
has not been going long enough to make
any figures, but I believe that there will
be a less percentage of men returned to
prison for second terms now than under
the old plan of keeping them confined all
the time.”</p>

<p><em>The State of Jails in Massachusetts.</em>—The
state board of health of Massachusetts
finds 45 jails in the commonwealth
unfit for occupancy. They are
unsanitary and not properly managed.
Describing his incarceration in the Middlesex
county house of correction in
Somerville, Mass., Rev. E. E. Bayliss
said in the Boston American of September
24th, that</p>

<p>“When prisoners are admitted they are
given no medical examination whatever.
The weak, the strong, the sick and the
well are all one in the eyes of the prison
officials. All receive the same food and
the same treatment.</p>

<p>“The result is that there are any number
of prisoners suffering from very serious
and shocking diseases, who receive
either no treatment or treatment of the
most perfunctionory sort. In addition all
these men use the same knives and forks,
the same drinking cups, and the same
towels as the rest of the men. They are
shaved every day with the same razor.</p>

<p>“In other words no precautions whatever
are taken to guard healthy individuals
from contamination from diseases,
the virulence and contagiousness of which
are only too well known.</p>

<p>“The sanitary conditions of the jail
are abominable. They are not fit to describe
in print, and they nauseate me
when I think of them. The bedding,
walls and floors swarm with vermin, and
the half-hearted attempt to get rid of
them by an occasional sprinkling of ill-smelling
powder only emphasizes their
presence.</p>

<p>“Humanity, common courtesy, the
slightest sympathetic realization that we
are all human beings, after all, is unknown.
There is no one to say a good
word to the prisoners. During the three
months I was there we had only two
sermons, and these were perfunctory in
the extreme, and delivered without the
slightest idea of appropriateness and of
crying spiritual needs of the listeners.”</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><em>Alien Criminals.</em>—A study recently
made by Joseph P. Byers, general secretary
of the state charities and prison
reform association of New Jersey shows
that 35 per cent. of the prisoners in that
state are foreign born. Of the inmates
of the state reformatory, 23 per cent. are
foreign-born and 45 per cent. are either
foreign-born or of foreign parentage.</p>

<p>Alien prisoners in 1909-10 comprised
one-fourth of all the inmates of the state
prison of New York.</p>

<p><em>What Miss Jane Addams Says.</em>—“More
and more our reformatories are
filled, not with criminals, but with the
boys who have in them the basis of play
unsatisfied, the basis of art unfulfilled,
even those beginnings of variation from
types which we call genius.</p>

<p>“It is these children, our brightest and
best, whom we are spoiling by giving
them no proper chance for development.
The city offers adventurous children
nothing to satisfy their desire for pleasure,
nothing which will allow them to
cherish their determination to conquer
the world and make it a better one.</p>

<p>“So these children go out and get into
trouble, or else they stay in their poor
houses and factories and turn into stupid
dullards, all initiative, all ambition
stamped out of them.”</p>

<p>A commission, one of whose members

<p>The commission wants 300 acres of
land, and an appropriation of $200,000
was made for purchasing the site and
beginning the preliminary work. The
commission proposes to locate the prison
within a radius of 50 or 60 miles of Columbus.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
